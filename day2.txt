Today's Agenda..

	1. OOPs- object oriented programming with python
		- it makes maintenance and development easiar
			- Class
				* collection of objects
				* collection objects and methods
				* logic will implement based on attribes and methods
				Ex: employee --> empname,empdes,empage
				#Syntax of class
				class Classname:
					statemnts
					.......
	
				self is reference variable
				it can be any name
				but it should be first parameter
				by using self parameter we can access all the attributes 



			- Object
				* real world entity which has state and bhaviour
				objectname = classname
				
			- Method
